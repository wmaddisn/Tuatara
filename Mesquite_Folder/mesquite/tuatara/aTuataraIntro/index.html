<font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" color="#333300"><p><font color="#663333"><strong>Tuatara</strong> is a package of Mesquite modules 
  designed for analyzing conservation priorities in a phylogenetic context. The 
  approach stems from the observation made by R.I. Vane-Wright and colleagues 
  at the Natural History Museum in London (1991), and refined by R.M. May of Oxford 
  (1990) that evolutionary distinctiveness would be a useful metric for helping 
  rank species for conservation. The emblematic species for such an approach is 
  the New Zealand tuatara, a lineage that roots deep (over 200 million years ago, Hugall et al., 2007) 
  and whose sister clade comprises all snakes and lizards. With the increase in 
large, complete, dated phylogenies, the approach can be made operational.</font></p>

<p><font color="#663333" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">This version of Tuatara is 1.01. It has the same calculations as version 1.0; the only change in version 1.01 concerns Mesquite's update notification system.  
  Tuatara requires Mesquite version 2. It is incompatible with 
  Mesquite version 1.12 and earlier.</font></p>

  <p><font color="#663333" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">You can also install Tuatara by hand. Download it  here: <a href="http://mesquiteproject.org/packages/tuatara/tuatara.zip">http://mesquiteproject.org/packages/tuatara/tuatara.zip</a>.  When you unzip it, 
  you will find it makes a directory  &quot;<strong>tuatara</strong>&quot;. 
  Please move &quot;<strong>tuatara</strong>&quot; inside the <strong>mesquite</strong> folder within your <strong>Mesquite_Folder</strong>. Thus, when you have moved 
  it, you should have &quot;tuatara&quot;, within &quot;mesquite&quot;, within

<p><font color="#663333">For Tuatara to calculate conservation priority measures 
  that consider phylogeny, you need to set up a data file with the species and 
  their phylogenetic tree. You can do this in the usual Mesquite way, for instance 
  importing a NEXUS or Phylip file, or starting from scratch by creating a new 
  block of taxa and naming them. Before attempting any of the calculations of 
  measures, open a Tree Window and arrange for the desired tree to be shown.</font></p>
<p>The <strong>phylogenetic tree</strong> should be shown in the Tree Window, and have branch 
  lengths associated. You can see the branch lengths labeled by going to the Drawing 
  menu of the Tree Window, to the Branch Lengths Labels submenu. You can also 
  see the branch lengths visually by asking that the tree be drawn with Branches 
  Proportional to Lengths (also in the Drawing menu). For some of the calculations, 
  polytomous trees are not permitted.</p>
<p>Many of the calculations also require an indication of the
  <strong>extinction risk</strong> of each species, that is, its <strong>probability of extinction</strong>. To indicate these, 
  create a Continuous data matrix (Characters menu, New Empty Matrix), and enter a character whose values are between 
  0.0 (species certain to survive) and 1.0 (species certain to go extinct). Then, 
  when asked by the calculation to choose a source of characters, choose Stored 
  Characters and this matrix.</p>

<p><font color="#663333" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Phylogenetic measures of conservation priority generally assess what evolutionary 
  history is represented (possibly uniquely) by a species, and thus which might 
  be lost if the species goes extinct. This is done by counting the length of 
  phylogenetic branches belonging to the species. The terminal branch of the species 
  belongs uniquely to it, but some measures also include some proportion of the 
  lengths of branches of ancestors shared with other species. The &quot;credit&quot; 
  for the length of an ancestral branch can be divided equally among all extant 
  descendant species (species-weighted sharing), or equally among the descendant 
  clades of the branch (clade-weighted sharing). We can think of the total branch length credited to the species as either &quot;the evolutionary history represented by the species&quot; or &quot;the distinctiveness of the species&quot;.</font></p>
<p><font color="#663333" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">There are two other considerations that have been proposed in phylogenetic 
  measures of conservation priority. First, one can consider using the estimated 
  extinction probabilities of species to estimate what might be the expected distinctiveness of the species in the future, after some extinction occurs (Steel et al. 2007; 
  Faith 2007). Second, one can multiply the distinctiveness of the species (the 
  history it represents) by its probability of extinction, so as to produce a 
  species &#8220;value&#8221; that includes the urgency with which we must act 
  to save it (Redding and Mooers, 2006; Isaac et al., 2007).</font></p>

<p><font color="#663333" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Tuatara permits you to mix and match these possibilities to generate several 
  alternative measures of conservation priority. Tuatara has three alternative 
  measures of a species&#8217; distinctiveness (history represented): (i) unique, (ii) including 
  ancestral branches weighted by related species or (iii) including ancestral 
  branches weighted by related clades. Each of these in turn can be measured either (i) 
  directly or (ii) as expected after some extinction, and each  can be 
  multiplied by current extinction risk (for urgency). For instance, EDGE (Isaac 
  et al. 2007) measures species value by terminal branch length plus species-weighted 
  shares of ancestral branches, which it then multiplies by extinction risk. HEDGE 
  (Steel et al. 2007) measures species value by terminal branch length, as expected 
  after some extinction, and weighted by extinction risk. If you choose to weight by extinction risk, then abbreviated name of the measure indicates this by including &quot;GE&quot;.</font></p>
<font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" color="#663333">
<p>The full suite of available measures of conservation priority is as follows:</p>
</font> 
<ul>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" color="#663333"><strong>Terminal 
    Branch Length</strong> &#8212; This measures the length of the terminal branch 
    belonging to the species (the pendant edge length). Optionally, this can be 
    weighted by extinction risk.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" color="#663333"><strong>Expected 
    Terminal Branch Length</strong> [HED and HEDGE)] &#8212; This considers extinction 
    probabilities of all species to find the expected terminal branch length of 
    the focal species. This measure was proposed by Steel et al. 2007 in two forms: 
    HED, which is not weighted by current extinction risk, and HEDGE, which is 
    weighted by current extinction risk. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" color="#663333"><strong>Evolutionary 
    Distinctiveness, species</strong> [ED and EDGE] &#8212; This measures the 
    length of the species' terminal branch plus its species-weighted shares of 
    ancestral branches. It was proposed by Isaac et al. 2007 as Evolutionary Distinctiveness (ED), and, when weighted by a particular set of current extinction risks (and then log-transformed), as EDGE. Our implementation differs slightly from theirs in allowing any set of current extinction risks to be used, and in not log-transforming the values.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" color="#663333"><strong>Expected 
    Evolutionary Distinctiveness, species</strong> &#8212; This considers extinction 
    probabilities to find the expected ED or EDGE after some extinction. This 
    &quot;expected&quot; version of ED is novel to Tuatara. The new algorithm 
    first traverses the tree from tips to root to calculate for each clade the 
    probability distribution of clade sizes following extinction, using the extinction 
    probabilities given and considering at each step in the traversal all possible 
    clade sizes for the left and right descendant clades of a node. Then, it traverses 
    from root to tips, carrying with it an array of conditional credits for branch 
    lengths and apportioning among left and right descendants, weighting by probabilities 
    of various possible clade sizes. The array stores credits at each node conditional 
    on the number of species that survive. For more details, see the source code. 
    [This measure cannot be calculated on trees with polytomies.]</font></li>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" color="#663333"><strong>Evolutionary 
    Distinctiveness, clades</strong> &#8212; This measures the length of the species' 
    terminal branch plus its clade-weighted shares of ancestral branches. It was 
    proposed by Redding &amp; Mooers 2006 as the &#8220;equal splits&#8221; distinctiveness 
    measure, and is abbreviated EDc in Tuatara. It can optionally be weighted 
    by current extinction risk (the &#8220;expected loss&#8221; measure of Redding 
    &amp; Mooers, 2006), and is then abbreviated EDcGE.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" color="#663333"><strong>Expected 
    Evolutionary Distinctiveness, clades</strong> &#8212; This considers extinction 
    probabilities to find the expected EDc or EDcGE after some extinction. This 
    &quot;expected&quot; version is novel to Tuatara. The new algorithm first 
    calculates each clade's probability of complete extinction as the product 
    of probabilities of the individual species contained. Then it traverses the 
    tree from root to tips, carrying with it credits for branch lengths and apportioning 
    them among descendant nodes. At each node the probabilities of alternative 
    scenarios of daughter clade extinctions are calculated (and there can be many 
    scenarios if the node is polytomous), and under each scenario the credit is 
    apportioned accordingly (and weighted by the probability of that scenario). 
    For more details, see the source code. [This measure cannot be calculated 
    on trees with polytomies larger than a certain size. Currently, polytomies 
    with more than 26 descendants are prohibited.]</font></li>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" color="#663333"><strong>Vane-Wright 
    et al.'s Distinctness</strong>&#8212; This measures the number of branches 
    a species is from the root, ignoring their lengths, scaled inversely by the 
    maximum value (distinctness of species = (max branches from root)/(branches 
    from root for species)). This is the original distinctiveness measure from 
    Vane-Wright et al., 1991. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" color="#663333"><strong>May's 
    Distinctness</strong>&#8212; This measures the sum of the number of descendants 
    of nodes on path from root to a species, scaled inversely by the maximum value 
    (distinctness of species = (max #descendants on path from root)/(#descendants 
    on path from root for species)). This is the distinctiveness measure suggested 
    by May 1990 as a modification of that of Vane-Wright et al., 1991.</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font color="#663333" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In Mesquite these measures, 
  if they permit polytomies, assume that the polytomies are &quot;hard&quot;, 
  that is, represent multiple instantaneous speciation and not uncertainty.</font>   </p>

<p><strong>Rarefy Tree by Extinction Probabilities</strong>: This feature deletes 
  species from the tree according to each species extinction probabilities (which 
  are stored in a continuous data matrix; see <a href="#settingup">setting up</a>). 
  Thus, if a species has extinction probability of 0.2, there is a 0.2 probability 
  it will be deleted from the tree. This feature therefore simulates a particular 
  scenario of survival of species. If you ask Mesquite to generate many such trees, 
  you can calculate how various phylogenetic statistics (whether conservation 
  oriented or not) will vary according to variation in what species survive. You 
  can access this by selecting &quot;Randomly Modify Current Tree&quot; in the 
  various places this occurs. For instance, you can make a chart of trees, using 
  Randomly Modify Current Tree as your source of trees. Or, you could generate 
  a block of such trees (Make New Tree Block from... in the Taxa &amp; Trees menu).</p>
<p><strong>Total Phylogenetic Diversity</strong>: This calculates the amount of history (or diversity) 
  represented by the tree, in the manner expected for conservation calculations. 
  It is simply the total path length (sum of branch lengths) of the tree, where 
  unassigned branches are treated as of zero length, and the root's length <strong>is</strong> 
  counted. This can be accessed wherever calculations are done that assign numbers 
  to trees (e.g., in a chart for trees, or in the List of Trees window, or in 
  the tree legend of the Tree Window). If some taxa are selected, then it gives the total path length of only the smallest subtree including all of the selected taxa, down to and including the root. (If no taxa are selected, then it uses the whole tree.)</p>
